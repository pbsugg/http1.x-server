#pseudocode for what i will need to accomplish with login procedures==end of release

Create login resources:
1) login (with post form, etc.)
2) registration

-Figure out where I am going to *store* all of this login info
  - parsing the login query
-Come up with a method for processing GET vs. POST

-Hook up the login functionality to the "visit" functionality, so that I'm tracking login visits
  --i.e., they have to be logged in to track visits
  (does this make sense for me? maybe i want to *add* functionality)

--show user info on the profile page based on login
