"As you refactor, favor methods that accept the data they need as arguments and return their work as a result. These are easy to test, since you can pass something in and assert that the result is what you expect. Methods that read and write data from instance variables are more difficult to setup."

5) Need to do the actual "client loop" of accepting a client connection.
